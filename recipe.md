Cook the noodles as per instructions on the back of the pack. 

Put a non-stick wide bottomed pan on a high heat to heat up. 

For the paste/sauce, peel the garlic and the ginger. Deseed the chilli if you want it less spicy. Put all the  paste/sauce ingredients into a blender (if you don’t have a high speed blender such as a nutri bullet best to chop the garlic, ginger before adding) and blend till smooth.

Finely chop the scallions, pepper and sugar snap peas. Chop the nub off the end of the pak choi and chop into bite size pieces.

Add the chopped scallions and peppers into the pan and cook for 2 minutes stirring regularly if it starts to stick to 2 tablespoons of the sauce and use it to ‘deglaze the pan’ (remove and incorporate any caramelisation from the bottom of the pan and incorporate. Add the pak choi and cook for another minute. Add the rest of the paste and the noodles and stir well incorporating everything. When it boils, remove from the heat. 

Finely slice the second half of the red chilli. Garnish each serving with toasted sesame seeds, sliced chilli or finely sliced radish.

Season with salt and pepper to your taste. Enjoy!
